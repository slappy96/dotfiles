#### SSH NOTES ####

## Generate ssh keys - will generate two (id_rsa and id_rsa.pub) unless specified
ssh-keygen

## General ssh format is
ssh user@host (host can be IP or domain name)

## Secure copy via SSH. Note I specified port 1803 with capital P
scp -P 1803 somefile user@archbox:/home/slappy

## Remove a cached key on a local machine/client
## This happens if known_hosts has ever connected to same domain name
## with a different address. Warning that shows is:
## "Warning: the ECDSA host key for 'myserver' differs from the key for the
## IP address '192.168.2.3'"

ssh-keygen -R 88.36.654.23 (or replace the IP with domain name munos.xyz)
ssh-copy-id


SSH KEYS (public key authentication)

1. Generate unique keys for user account
ssh-keygen -t rsa (will create a file in home directory under hidden directory called .ssh.  The file will be called id_rsa
	id_rsa (private key) id_rsa.pub (public key)
2. Add public key to SSH server
ssh-copy-id root@server1
3. Make sure private key is in memory so it doesn't prompt for name and password
ssh-agent
ssh-add
ssh-add -l (to check and make sure it was added.
4. Set up SSH server to allow public key authentication instead of password
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
go to password authentication section and change to no
5. service sshd restart
6. start ssh session
ssh root@server1 (it will ask for passphrase for key and that's it)
